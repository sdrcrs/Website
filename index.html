    <h1>Aurora Hunter - Fire and Ice Trip<span>&#x1f30b</span>&#x1f3d4<span></span><br> Welcome to my Icelandic Adventure</h1>

      <p>Iceland, a Nordic island nation, is defined by its dramatic landscape with volcanoes, geysers, hot springs and lava fields. <br>Massive glaciers are protected in Vatnajökull and Snæfellsjökull national parks. </p>

      <p><b>Northern Lights Iceland</b><br>
        The best time to see aurora borealis in Iceland is between September and April. It's when the nights are dark enough to see the aurora. Iceland only gets 4-5 hours of daylight in midwinter, providing endless opportunities to hunt for aurora borealis during that time.</p>

  <a href="https://en.vedur.is/weather/forecasts/aurora/"> <br> Northern Lights forecast</a>


   <p>The spectacle of Aurora Borealis requires dark and partly clear skies.<br>
    The map of Iceland shows forecast of cloud cover. Green areas are cloudy and white areas clear skies. <br>
    The forecast of auroral activity at midnight, scale 0 to 9. Higher this forecast, higher are the changes to encounter Lady Aurora.<br> At any given moment, the sun is ejecting charged particles from its corona, or upper atmosphere, creating what's called the solar wind. When that wind slams into Earth's ionosphere, or upper atmosphere, the aurora is born.</p>

  <h2> Things to Pack: </h2>   
    <p> This is what I believe you must pack. I use to travel only with my
      backpack, 5 days trip, but fell free to pack everything you want. I prefer
      don't kind of waist my time waiting for luggages. This is only a personal
      choice, but go for it if you need or if your trip is longer than 5 days.
